# **Temperature Regulation Using Phase Change Materials (PCMs)**

## **Project Overview**

This project explores the use of Phase Change Materials (PCMs) for effective temperature regulation inside insulated containers. By leveraging the unique thermal properties of PCMs, particularly their ability to absorb and release heat during phase transitions, we aim to create a system that can maintain stable internal temperatures. 

Two identical containers were constructed—one using PCM-based insulation (paraffin wax) and the other without insulation. The temperature profiles of both setups were analyzed under controlled conditions to assess the effectiveness of PCM technology in maintaining temperature stability.

## **Objectives**

1. **Compare Temperature Profiles:**  
   Through careful experimentation and data collection, we compared the temperature profiles of setups with and without PCM insulation. Our goal was to assess the impact of PCM on temperature regulation.

2. **Evaluate Efficiency:**  
   We quantified factors such as temperature stabilization, heat retention, and energy storage capacity to evaluate the overall effectiveness of the PCM-based thermal storage system compared to conventional setups.

## **Introduction to PCMs**

Phase Change Materials (PCMs) are innovative substances capable of undergoing a phase transition—such as melting or solidification—at specific temperature ranges. This unique property allows them to store and release large amounts of thermal energy during these phase transitions, making them highly effective for temperature regulation.

PCMs have gained significant attention in various industries, such as construction, automotive, electronics, and energy storage, due to their ability to enhance thermal comfort, improve energy efficiency, and mitigate temperature fluctuations.

### **Theory Behind PCMs**

The principle behind PCMs lies in their ability to absorb or release thermal energy as they transition between different phases (typically solid and liquid) at a constant temperature, known as the phase change point. During the phase transition process, the material absorbs or releases energy in the form of latent heat, while maintaining a constant temperature until the transition is complete.

This thermal energy exchange allows PCMs to act as thermal batteries, effectively buffering temperature fluctuations and maintaining stable thermal conditions.

## **Experiment Setup**

To assess the effectiveness of PCM-based temperature regulation, we designed and conducted an experiment using two containers of identical dimensions (30cm x 30cm x 30cm). One container incorporated PCM-based insulation (paraffin wax), while the other served as a control without insulation. 

Key aspects of the experiment:
- **Materials:** MDF sheets for container construction, aluminum foil, and paraffin wax as the PCM.
- **Heat Source:** A 100-watt bulb was used as a heat source to simulate real-world heating conditions.
- **Temperature Measurement:** Digital thermometers were strategically placed to monitor temperature variations.

Temperature data was recorded for both the heating and cooling phases, allowing for visual comparison and analysis of temperature profiles.

## **Observations**

### **Heating Phase:**
Initially, the temperature of both containers rose rapidly. However, the PCM-containing container exhibited a unique temperature behavior due to the phase change of paraffin wax. Once the melting point was reached, the temperature stabilized as the PCM absorbed heat, delaying further temperature increases. This phenomenon highlighted the energy storage capability of PCMs.

### **Cooling Phase:**
During the cooling phase, the PCM solidified, releasing the stored heat and slowing the temperature decline. This process demonstrated the PCM's effectiveness in maintaining temperature stability by acting as a thermal buffer.

## **Results**

The experiment revealed that the PCM-based setup demonstrated an efficiency of 79.365%. The temperature profiles for both containers showed distinct trends, confirming the PCM's ability to regulate temperature effectively. These results underscore the potential of PCM technology for thermal management in practical applications.
